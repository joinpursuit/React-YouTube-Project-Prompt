      <p>
        I am a performing artist and software engineer who works at the
        intersection of theatre arts, technology, and social equity.
        <br /> I am passionate about accessibility, advocacy, building
        community, and financial literacy. I desire to design products that help
        communities thrive, especially during times of need. <br />
        My goal is to join a company that creates products or offers services
        that cater to the local or larger community.

        one day also help others better thier lives. <br />I hope to be able to
